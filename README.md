This is the project readme file, there's a reason why it's called readme. Because you're supposed to read it. As it should contain usefull information. Like:
Project plans, processes, release changes etc.

The best way to get about it is to create greppable list of items like the one below. 

TODO: Write specification - 4d
TODO: Specify review process - 1d
TODO: Create test process - 2w
TODO: Create report of the project progress -  1d
TODO: Test and write calc.sh shript - 4h

Then you can generate a list with a few commands, remember, the onec you used to punch in to the terminal when you where programming.
